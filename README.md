### Directions:

This is starter code for an in-class code along. You can refer to the lesson notes here: https://wdi_sea.gitbooks.io/notes/content/07-angular/angular-http/readme.html

## Set up

You will need to 

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. Run *npm install*
3. Open your code in sublime text

## Purpose

Together we will implement the movie search function. This teaches us how to 
use an API call with $http, which is Angular's way of forming requests. You 
will recognize that it looks a lot like AJAX.

In addition to accessing an API, we'll get further practice using Angular 
and thinking of programming in a data-driven way.

Finally, we will also use this opportunity to use $watch to listen for 
changes to our front-end data.
